# 🎬 Movie Database Web Scraper: 🍿 scraping_corns

This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python and BeautifulSoup. It collects movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB), processes it using pandas, and exports the cleaned data to a CSV file (excluded from this repository). The project is built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook and is intended for educational and portfolio purposes.

## 🧠 Features

- Scrapes movie data across multiple pages  
- Parses HTML using `BeautifulSoup`  
- Cleans and structures data using `pandas`  
- Exports the final dataset 


## 🛠️ Libraries Used

* `requests` – for sending HTTP requests
* `BeautifulSoup` – for parsing HTML
* `numpy` – for numerical operations
* `pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning
* `re` – for regular expression operations
